1- PCA is performed on the all the trials from all selected conditinos (at first, using no rejection),
2- The movies are reconstructed leaving the 1st component output

In 'PCAwith_onlyEI' - only blank+US trials where used in the PCA analysis.
In 'PCA_toneUS' - all blank+US+tone trials where used in the PCA analysis.
In 'PCA_onlyUS_seedrejectON' - all trials where used for PCA but the seed connectivity left the rejected out
